{"name":"Twitch-TV","tagline":"","body":"This project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front-End Development curriculum.\r\n\r\nObjective:\r\nBuild a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/GJKRxZ.\r\n\r\nUser stories:\r\n\r\n1. As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.\r\n2. As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.\r\n3. As a user, if Free Code Camp is streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.\r\n4. As a user, I can search through the streams listed.\r\n5. If a streamer has closed his/her Twitch account, it will not be displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nCredit for the fire CSS effect goes to Duncan Grant atÂ http://www.midwinter-dg.com/permalink-7-great-css-based-text-effects-using-the-text-shadow-property_2011-03-03.html.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
