This project was built as a part of Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front-End Development curriculum.

Objective:
Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/GJKRxZ.

User stories:

1. As a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. As a user, I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. As a user, if Free Code Camp is streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
4. As a user, I can search through the streams listed.
5. If a streamer has closed his/her Twitch account, it will not be displayed to the user.
